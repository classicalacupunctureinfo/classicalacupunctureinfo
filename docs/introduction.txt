Introduction to Indian classical Acupuncture 

Indian Classical Acupuncture is a scientific and holistic method of treatment. Disease is nothing but stagnation of (morbid matter) accumulated waste in the body and obstruction of energy flow in the acupuncture (meridians) channels. The dysfunctions of five major internal organs are responsible for stagnation of waste in humanbody. We can regain health by identifying the organs which are weak and treating them through acupuncture points in the energy channel and by removing the waste which is responsible for the disease.

In Acupuncture, it is not at all necessary to get laboratory tests done, such as blood glucose, urine, motion, sperm phlegm, x-rays or other types of scan reports. Neither are any kind of medicines like tablets, capsules, injections, tonic, syrupetc., are required. Whether the disease is at its initial stage or final, Indian Classical Acupuncture rectifies the malfunctions of the body and gives complete cure to the patient.

More than 5000 years ago Acupuncture originated in China and has been in practice since then. But it was from the early 20th century that Acupuncture started to spread to countries like America, Japan, Srilanka, etc. Acupuncture was welcomed all over the world.

Indian Classical Acupuncture is a constructive method of treatment which aims at removing the basic cause of the disease through rational use of the elements freely available in nature. It is not only a system of healing, but also a way of life, a complete revolution in the art and science of living.

It is wrong to understand Indian Classical Acupuncture as the acupuncture practiced by Indians. Rather, Indian Classical Acupuncture is the acupuncture system of, understanding the body on the basis of Indian naturopathy philosophies.

Presence of life is invisible. Activity of life is invisible. We can only feel or sense its presence by the external signs but we cannot see it. The root cause of a disease is also invisible, also is the energy which cures it. As such, to have faith on invisible things that can be experience is the basis of Indian Classical Acupuncture.
    Giving treatment to the root cause of a disease rather than giving treatment to the symptoms of the disease is the method of treatment practiced in the Indian Classical Acupuncture. Rectifying the root cause is the only way to eradicate the disease. It is enough that we stimulate the natural life energy of the body to remove the disease. The body"s defense force the immunity power will look after the eradication of the disease. The method of treatment, to give this stimulation, requires only a single needle or a touch.

The first basic principle of Indian Classical Acupunctureis that all forms of disease are due to the same cause, namely, the accumulation of waste materials.

The second basic principle is that all acute diseases such as fevers, colds, inflammations, digestive disturbances and skin eruptions are nothing more than self-initiated efforts on the part of the body to throw off the accumulated waste materials. That all chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, rheumatism, asthma, kidney disorders, are the result of continued suppression of the acute diseases through harmful methods such as drugs, vaccines, narcotics and gland extracts.

The third basic principle is that the body contains an elaborate healing mechanism which has the power to bring about a return to normal condition of health; provided right methods are employed to enable it do so. In other words, the power to cure the disease lies within the body itself, only.
