The urinary bladder channel  begins in the interior edge of the eye and runs parallel to the midline of the body over the scalp and reaches the base of the head in the posterior side. It splits into two from that point. First part runs at a distance of 1.5 cun from the midline of the body downwards, traversing the point located midway of the buttock and thigh crease, reaching the midpoint of the knee crease. The other part, traverses 3.0 cun from the midline of the body, crosses the spinal region, traverses along the outer edge of the buttock and thigh crease, and then connects with the first part middle of the knee crease. Then it traverses vertically downwards, along the centre part of the calf muscle, reaches the outer side of the leg slightly above the ankle joint, then it traverses along the outer side of the foot, along the border formed by the two skin colours of the foot, finally ending at 0.1 cun above the outer nail base of the 5th toe.
