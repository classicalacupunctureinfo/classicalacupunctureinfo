THE LIFE ENERGY

The energy required by the life for maintaining the body and for feeling the external sensations is called as the Life energy.

This life energy is classified as

1)Internal Life Energy

2)Extenal Life Energy

Internal Life energy - This is the energy present in each and every organism by nature. This cannot be created or increased.

External Life Energy is the energy received from the Universe by the human body through the five elements. The energy required for our everyday functioning, digestion, maintenance is obtained through the organs by the body. This is obtained through food, air, water and other such natural sources by the body.

 ENERGY DISTRIBUTION 

 Since our body obtains energy from external sources, it is called as External Life energy. The energy obtained from food, water and the universe by the body is shared and distributed as mentioned below. 

1. Functional Energy 
2. Digestive Energy 
3. Maintenance Energy 

FUNCTIONAL ENERGY
 One part of the energy obtained externally is used for the functioning of the body. There are two types of functions. One of them is involuntary functions. These functions are performed by the body without our supervision by nature. The other is voluntary functions. The functions which are performed by our supervision. The breathing action of lungs, the continuous pumping action of the heart are involuntary functions, while functions like walking, talking are voluntary functions. 

DIGESTIVE ENERGY
The second part of the external energy is used by the body for digestion. From the air we breathe, the water we drink and the food we eat, energy needs to be absorbed by the body. The Digestive energy serves to perform this function. One part of this absorbed energy is reserved for digestion. This is because one of the easiest ways to obtain energy again and again is through digestion.

MAINTENANCE ENERGY

The external energy is utilized by the body in 3 parts. The third part is used for maintenance. This part is considerably larger than the functional and digestive energy in size. Functional Energy is important for proper functioning of the body. Without functional energy, the basic functions could not be performed. Also, for obtaining the energy from external sources, digestive energy is indispensable. Maintaining the functional and digestive energies is the purpose of Maintenance Energy.

The defects developed in the internal organs because of the activities performed by the Functional Energy is rectified by the Maintenance Energy. Similarly, the elimination of waste particles produced as a result of the activities of the digestive energy is also carried out by the Maintenance Energy. Therefore Maintenance Energy facilitates the maintenance and management of the other energies. This is known as Immunity Power in Modern medicine.
