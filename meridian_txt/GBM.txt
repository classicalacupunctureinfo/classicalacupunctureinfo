The gall bladder channel begins at 0.5 cun from the outer edge of the eye and traverses downwards to the front of the ear, 0.5 cun below SI 19, then moves upward and reaches the lateral part of the head. Then from a distance of 1.5 cun form the upper edge of the earlobe, it traverses around the ear lobe till the point parallel to the end of earlobe is reached. Then, it takes another parallel curve which traverses around the earlobe and reaches the lateral part of the head, reaching the forehead region at 1 cun vertically above the eyebrow. Then, it traverses backwards along the hairlines in the head and moves towards the depression where the head is connected to the neck. From there, it moves via the outer neck, collar bone and reaches just below the armpit and traverse  towards the midline slanting downward and reaches between the 7th and 8th intercostal ribs vertically below the nipple. From there, it moves diagonally reaching the edge of the 12th intercostal rib. Then, diagonally it moves to a point which lies at the intersection of the horizontal line drawn from the umbilicus and a vertical line drawn from the outer edge of the 11th rib. From there it reaches downward to the point in the buttock region, where is 2/3rd of the total distance from the midline of the body posteriorly. After that, it traverses across the midpoint of the outer thigh, through the knee, finally ending in the point which is 0.1 cun above the outer nail base of the 4th toe.
